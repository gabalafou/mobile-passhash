For more information about the Mobile Passhash app, visit the following URL:
https://github.com/gabalafou/mobile-passhash

The developers of the Mobile Passhash app collect no data about end-users. Any
data that may be collected about the end-user in the course of downloading,
installing, and using the app would be the result of third parties that provide
the environment in which app runs (for example: Google, Apple, Expo).

The app is built on top of an SDK (software development kit) known as Expo. The
Expo platform collects very little information about end-users of the Mobile
Passhash app. To learn more, visit: https://expo.dev/privacy-explained
