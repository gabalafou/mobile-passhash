# Mobile Passhash (Beta)

Simple, effective password security... on your phone!


## Install Beta

This app **is still in beta**, and not yet available in either the Google or Apple app stores.
My ultimate goal is to distribute this app on the app stores.

### Android

1. Install [Expo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) from the Google app store.
2. Go to [https://expo.io/@gabalafou/mobile-passhash](https://expo.io/@gabalafou/mobile-passhash).
3. Scan the QR code on that page with the Expo app.
4. The app should load inside Expo.

### iOS

1. Download Apple TestFlight from the App Store.
2. Open this link on your phone: https://testflight.apple.com/join/CECgG47B

Pro tip - make sure you've enabled [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460). That way, whenever you copy a password generated by the app, you can paste it on your desktop (into a password field).

## Develop / Run in Emulator

[![Runs with Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Runs%20with%20Expo-4630EB.svg?style=flat-square&logo=EXPO&labelColor=f3f3f3&logoColor=000)](https://expo.io/)

This section assumes that you are already familiar with how to run commands on the command line and run phone emulators on your computer.

Some prerequisites:
- Node.js
- Git
- npm
- Expo

This project was made with Expo. To learn more, visit [https://expo.io](https://expo.io).

    npm install expo-cli --global

If you want to develop on this app, or run it in an emulator, you'll need to clone this repo, then:

    npm install
    expo start

From there, follow the instructions on screen.


## History and Motivation

TL;DR-- Years ago, I downloaded a Firefox extension called [Passhash](https://github.com/wijjo/PassHash) to better manage my passwords. The extension became obsolete, but I still needed a way to manage my passwords.

Problem: I stopped using Firefox (unsponsored product plug: I now use [Brave](https://brave.com/)), and I found myself needing to log into more and more apps or sites from one device.

Solution: I used a feature of the extension to export a standalone HTML page that I then hosted on my own web site. This page was a snapshot of all of the sites that I had used Passhash on and the password settings for each of those sites.

Problem: Eventually, as I joined more sites and changed passwords on others, the page got out of sync with my logins. Plus, the page was always a bit cumbersome to use on my mobile phone (the standalone page generated by the extension was not mobile-optimized). Plus, I never really liked the idea of putting that page out there on the open web. Even it didn't store any of my passwords or transmit them over the network, it did provide a list of sites that I had passwords for, as well as some details about the password for each of those sites, such as how many characters long the password was.

Solution: I pretty much always have my mobile phone with me. For some sites, I even *have* to use my mobile phone because of two-factor authentication. So the idea came to me to write a phone app version of the Passhash Firefox extension. Plus, I had been looking for a fairly simple app to build so I could start learning how to develop mobile apps. Since I already had significant React experience, and I didn't necessarily want to limit the app to one particular phone OS, I decided to build the app with React Native.


## Legal and Licenses

I am required by the Mozilla license from [the original Passhash project](https://github.com/wijjo/PassHash) to disclose the changes I made to source code from that project. I copied one file, `passhash-common.js`, from that project. I deleted all lines from that file that my project didn't need, and I added ES6 import/export statements. I have included [a diff file](passhash-diff.patch) in this repo to show more precisely the modifications I made.

The code for this project is licensed under the MIT license.
